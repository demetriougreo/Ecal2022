In this file you find the link for the DataSet which can be used for an example of the program. Using this dataset, somebody could run directly the time calibration
algorithm, even if there are certain issues with it. In general this dataset is used for track construction and projection as well. To manage to proejct the tracks, 
track reconstfruction has to take place. This is acheived with the track-file construction. At any given moment the Analysis folder contains a perfectly ready set of
data, to be deployed.
