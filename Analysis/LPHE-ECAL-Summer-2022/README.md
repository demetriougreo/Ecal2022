# LPHE-ECAL-Summer-2022
This repository contains the scripts developed during the summer 2022 internship for the prototype ECAL Detector 

In the following links of the current repository the reader would find three major scripts. The reconstruction of particle trucks and their 2D and 3D representation as well as the time-amplitude and energy calibration of the SiPMs. They would be followed by a brief descripton of the possible filters that could be applied aiming to elimintate electronic noise.
